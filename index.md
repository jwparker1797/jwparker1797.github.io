# Welcome to my GIS Developer Blog!

I am very excited that you have landed on my page.

It probably means one of a few things:

1. You are lost.
   - Hit the back button in your browser until you see something you recognize.
2. You know me and am curious in what I do. 
   - This page probably won't help you understand, sorry. (It's like google maps...)
3. You really like -REALLY- GIS and would like to know more about getting into GIS Development.
   - This place is for you!

## Why?

## About me

## About you

## Goals of this site
- Provide a place for GIS people to get started in programming and software development.
